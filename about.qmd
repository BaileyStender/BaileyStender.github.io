About Me:

-My name is Bailey Stender and I am a third-year undergraduate student at CSU. I am majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Conservation Biology and Watershed Science. I hope to pursue a career in the field after graduating and want to work in conservation, ecology, or natural resources. My interests outside of my studies are rock climbing, camping, hiking, reading, and crafting.
