    "text": "Hello! My name is Bailey Stender and Iâ€™m a senior majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability and minoring in Watershed Science and Conservation Biology. Last summer I was a part of the CNHP Siegele Conservation Internship and worked in the field on several different projects. I am interested in conservation and ecology-based work and am eager to gain more experience working in the field and conducting research. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, camping, journaling, and crafting. I currently work at the CSU Rec as a climbing wall assistant."
